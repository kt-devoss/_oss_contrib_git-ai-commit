# Git AI Commit Integration

## Commit Workflow
When making commits, always use the `git-ai-commit` CLI tool instead of regular `git commit`. This tool automatically generates AI-powered commit messages based on your staged changes.

### Recommended Commands:
- Use `git-ai-commit` instead of `git commit` for AI-generated commit messages
- Use `git-ai-commit conventional` for conventional commit format
- Use `git-ai-commit summarize` to get a quick overview of changes before committing
- Use `git-ai-commit help-ai [question]` if you need assistance with the tool

### Setup Instructions:
1. Ensure git-ai-commit is installed: `pip install git-ai-commit`
2. Configure your API keys: `git-ai-commit config --setup`
3. Set up git hooks: `git-ai-commit hook --setup`

### Workflow Integration:
- Before committing, stage your changes with `git add`
- Instead of `git commit -m "message"`, simply run `git-ai-commit`
- The tool will analyze your changes and suggest an appropriate commit message
- Review and accept the AI-generated message or customize as needed

This ensures consistent, descriptive commit messages that follow best practices and provide clear context about the changes made.
